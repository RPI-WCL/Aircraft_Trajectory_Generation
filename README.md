# Aircraft_Trajectory_Generation 

##### This is the companion code for [Flight Trajectory Planning for Fixed-Wing Aircraft in Loss of Thrust Emergencies.](http://wcl.cs.rpi.edu/papers/trajectory_tech_report_oct_17.pdf "Research Paper")

##### Versions:
* v_T.xx - generates trajectories with 20, 30 and 45 degree bank angles with safety metrics.
* v_O.xx - generates trajectories with only one specified bank angle (no safety metrics).
